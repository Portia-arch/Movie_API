# Project Title

Rumplestilkins's Movie_API
This is a react movie app that uses an API from the Omdbapi. 
The Omdbapi allows us to send them an IMDb movie ID as a query parameter 
and they'll return a JSON with all the data we need.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes please 

Clone the repo first run
` npm i`<br />
` npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run the app

```
npm 
react
axios
```

## Built With

* [REACT](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The Library used
* [JAVASCRIPT](https://www.javascript.com/) - Language used
* [AXIOS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Used for making API calls
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - To style the content
* [MATERIAL UI](https://material-ui.com/) - Framework used to create the components
* [OMDBAPI](http://www.omdbapi.com/) - API generator

## CheckList
`Architecture`<br/>
* which can be broken up into 5 subcategories: languages, API, frameworks, integrations and topology. I considered these as the main aspect to spend time exploring when building my web application.
`CI (Continuous Integration)`<br/>
* It allowed me to focus on building features/components instead of doing monotonous tasks such as testing, building and deploying, which left room for human error.
`Performance`<br/>
* I had to make sure that the loading time isn't long as user get bored while waiting for an app to load. Make sure that all my components are rendered and that all the api queries are executed.

## Improvements
*If i had more time I would have tried to use a database to list and store the movies that were supposed to be added. I would've been required to use postgres and express as they work best for me. But I still intend on making this improvemnt in my own time.
